Content was retrieved from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/), using [wayback-machine-downloader](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader). Some post-processing has been done (see `scripts/postprocessing.py`) to remove unused JavaScript, but otherwise the content should be the same.
